# Saladin Showdown

An event in the same spirit as the *Barbarossa Brawl*.
Players defend Acre against Crusader armies and compete to obtain high scores.
Everyone who achieves a score that crosses a certain threshold is entered into a drawing to win a prize.

## Sounds

The voice acting from the English version of the original game is used.

## Timer

There are two timers:

1. A 5:00 countdown until the attacks begin.
2. A 25:00 countdown until the player wins.

In total the scenario takes 30 minutes.

## Jerusalem

The the original campaign Jerusalem is the Byzantines.
In the Definitive Edition the player is the Franks.
I'll revert them to the Byzantines to increase civilization variety, since there already is a Franks player.

## Persian Outpost

The Persian Outpost will provide fully upgraded Elite War Elephants and periodic "sling".
Each shipment of Elite War Elephants increases the player's maximum population limit by the number of elephants.

The elephants transports run at these times:

1. 10:00 - 5 Elephants
2. 15:00 - 10 Elephants
3. 23:00 - 20 Elephants

The slings run at these times:

1. 7:30 - 500 Food
2. 13:37 - 500 Food, 500 Gold
3. 19:00 - 500 Food, 500 Stone
4. 25:00 - 500 Food, 500 Wood, 500 Gold, 500 Stone
